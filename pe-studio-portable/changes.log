		Summary of the features of pestudio & pestudio-pro at following URL:
		www.winitor.com/tools/pestudio/current/pestudio-features.pdf
			
		Some features are availabe only in the professional version of pestudio.
		The free version of pestudio may not be used in a professional environment.

		When retrieving the scores from Virustotal, pestudio NEVER submits 
		the sample itself! pestudio only submits the hash (MD5) of the 
		sample being analysed.
